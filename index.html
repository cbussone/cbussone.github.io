    <h2> What We Offer </h2>
    <p> CSquar will offer a wide range of products to take your game to the next level: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide players with analytical reports that identify trends in their performances, these can be positive negative or neutral “Last 11 games aim has been 25% worse than normal”</li>
      <li>Provide players with ratings on their individual aspects of their game so they distinctly know the highest value areas of improvement and can track their progress in an objective manner, which is very satisfying.</li>
      <li>Provide players with the ability to input their own thoughts and include those in their training plan, suggestions and routines</li>
      <li>Provide players with maps created in UEFN that are tailored towards training a specific part of their game, that way our training programs we assign to them are able to be carried out all within our ecosystem. For example, a player struggles with situations where their opponent is 1 full tile away, we make a map designed to have multiple drills for instances similar to this and give them their “reps” or timing goals for practice and the ability to document it </li>
      <li>Implement an intelligent programming system that enables players to remain accountable and work hard, but within their means: take in their schedule or let them tell you how much time they have for x day for y time period (or customize it) and build a smart training schedule around this to optimize their growth for weakest categories or categories where growth gives the most benefit (this does not necessarily have to be their weakest category, perhaps they are good at shotgun aim and suck at aiming with a sniper, but it is still much higher ev to devote time to shotgun aim) </li>
      <li>Drop maps to optimize the path they take in the air when they jump out of the bus </li>
      <li>Optimal looting paths conveniently solved for them so they don’t have to do it themselves, the pros are AMAZING at this, but avg comp player sucks</li>
      <li>Storm surge strategies and vantage points to take in difficult lobbies</li>
      <li>Maybe even for premium users or smth or another add on, scan players computers to optimize the hardware and fix any settings that are not optimized on their GPU, CPU, computer files or game files </li>
    </ul>
